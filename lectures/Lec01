AI applications
=================================================

Robotics
- Planning (related to pathfinding)
- Pathfinding (great detail)
- Localization

Games
- 2+ players (chess, briefly talk about video games)

Logic
- Theorem proving
- Formal Analysis (formal methods, code correctness)
- Constraint Satisfaction (* these are difficult, so we can only apply heuristics)

Decision Making
- Expert Systems (top 5 most likely things)

Recommendation Systems
- what people will like

Classification / Pattern Analysis
- spam detection

- Being more human (Siri)

=================================================
Program / Algorithm is an intelligent agent

example agents
- search engine
- reactive agent (no planning, analysis, only responds when something happens)

agents
- perceive / measure / sense the environment
- acting on the environment

utility function <- maximize utility over time
