Constraint Satisfaction
(I can't get no)

restrictions on variables
set of variables represent your problem
ex. quantities in chemical reaction, time / schedule for operation

- set of variables Xi
- each variable has a domain di
- goal test -> checks for a solution (if assigning each variables satisfy the constraints)

map colouring problem
constraint graph

edges represent constraints, nodes represent countries
types of CSPs (constraint solving problems) which are we solving here?

linear programming -> CSPs with continuous variables
discrete variables
-> finite  (graph colouring)
-> infinite domain (scheduling)
-> binary variables

CSP solving

we have a search graph
root node is an empty assignment of variables
children of each node is a single assignment of colouring to one country

DFS - Backtracking Search

- expansion of nodes
portugal = red, germany= green, france = cyan
eventually you assigned valid value to each variables
or current assignment breaks the constraints, so we backtrack
france = red, germany = green, belgium = cyan, netherlands = y

1. f = c
2. g = r
3. b = y
4. s = g
5. lx = lx
